Children are allowed to propose events for inclusion in the calendar while parents are allowed to approve or deny children events and create events of their own. This was a group project built in conjunction with three other Lambda School developers. My role in the project was back end database management, front end state management using the React Context Api, and event creating, editing, and sorting using the react-select package."

The rules to Help Ryan Study are simple, use the arrow keys to help Ryan collect Lambda coins and avoid the cat. Occasionally, a bonus coin featuring the logo of a technology learned at Lambda school will drop from the top of the screen."
